"Definition of Heritage Ranks
The Alabama Natural Heritage Program uses the Heritage ranking system developed by The Nature Conservancy. Each species is assigned two ranks; one representing its range-wide or global status (G rank), and one representing its status in the state (S rank).  Species with a rank of 1 are most critically imperiled; those with a
rank of  5 are most secure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Global Ranking System
G1      Critically imperiled globally (5 or fewer occurrences) G2      Imperiled globally (6 to 20 occurrences).
G3      Either very rare and local throughout its range or found locally in a restricted range (21 to 100 occurrences).
G4      Apparently secure globally. G5      Demonstrably secure globally.
GH     Of historical occurrence throughout its range. GU     Possibly in peril range-wide but status uncertain. GX     Believed to be extinct throughout range.
G?      Not ranked to date.
G#T# Rank for subspecies or varieties where # is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, H, U, X, or ?.
HYB    Hybrid
Special state ranking for migrants:
SZ      Not of conservation concern in Alabama because species in this category are so widely and unreliably distributed during migration or in winter that no small set of sites could be set aside with the hope of significantly furthering their conservation.  A rank of SZN indicates the species does not breed in Alabama. Species that have resident breeding populations that are augmented in winter by non-breeding migrants may have dual ranks, one each for the breeding (B) and non-breeding (N) components.
SB      Regularly occurring, migratory and present only during the breeding season.  A rank of S3B indicates a species uncommon during the breeding season (spring/summer) in Alabama.
SN      Regularly occurring, usually migratory and typically non-breeding species in Alabama; this category includes migratory birds, bats, sea turtles, and cetaceans which do not breed in Alabama but pass through twice a year or may remain in winter.  A rank
of S2B,S5N indicated a rare breeder but a common winter resident.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"State Ranking System
S1       Critically imperiled in Alabama because of extreme rarity (5 or fewer occurrences of very few remaining individuals or acres) or because of some factor(s) making it especially vulnerable to extirpation from Alabama.
S2       Imperiled in state because of rarity (6 to 20 occurrences or few remaining individuals or acres) or because of some factor(s) making it very vulnerable to extirpation from Alabama.
S3       Rare or uncommon in Alabama (on the order of 21 to 100 occurrences).
S4       Apparently secure in Alabama, with many occurrences.
S5       Demonstrably secure in Alabama and essentially ""ineradicable"" under present conditions.
SA      Accidental in Alabama, including species (usually birds or butterflies) recorded once or twice or only at very great intervals, hundreds or even thousands of miles outside their usual range; a few of these species may even have bred on the one or two occasions they were recorded.
SE      An exotic established in Alabama.
SH      Of historical occurrence, perhaps not verified in the past 20 years, and suspected to be still extant.
SR      Reported, but without persuasive documentation which would provide a basis for either accepting or rejecting the report (e.g. misidentified specimen). Some of these are very recent discoveries for which the program has not yet received first-hand information; others are old, obscure reports that are hard to dismiss because the habitat is now destroyed.
SRF    Reported in error (falsely), but this error persisted in the literature.
SU      Possibly in peril in Alabama but status uncertain; more information needed.
SX      Apparently extirpated from Alabama. S?       Not ranked to date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
