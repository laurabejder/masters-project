# Master's project
This Github repository contains the data, code, html pages and visualizations that together makes up my master's thesis at Columbia Journalism School. The project examines the decades long decline in aquatic biodiversity in the southeastern United States, what caused this decline and what is being done to reverse it. 

The result is the article
[Crisis in the Currents: Alabamaâ€™s Tug-of-War for the Future of Freshwater Biodiversity](https://laurabejder.com/masters-project/)

#### The `data` directory

#### The `images` directory

#### The `maps` directory

#### The `shapefiles` directory
This directory contains shapefiles for the geographical distribution of all federally listed endangered and threatened aquatic species that occur primarily in the southeastern region. All the files are downloaded from the [US Fish and Wildlife Services website](https://www.fws.gov/species/search).
