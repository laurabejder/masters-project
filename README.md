# Master's project
This Github repository contains the data, code, html pages and visualizations that together makes up my master's thesis at Columbia Journalism School. The project examines the decades long decline in aquatic biodiversity in the southeastern United States, what caused this decline and what is being done to reverse it. 

The result is the article
[Crisis in the Currents: Alabamaâ€™s Tug-of-War for the Future of Freshwater Biodiversity](https://laurabejder.com/masters-project/)

The file `index.html` contains the html code for the full webpage linked above.

#### Notebooks
- `dam-analysis.ipynb`: This notebook contains an analysis of the size, ownership and age of the dams in the Southeast.
- `species-analysis.ipynb`: This notebook contains the majority of the projects data analysis including grouping by states, species and endangerment.
- `state-level-analysis.ipynb`: This notebook allows you to run analysis on the data from the state organizations.

#### The `data` directory
All the data files that are needed to replicate the analysis in the notebooks. The data comes from [Natureserve](https://explorer.natureserve.org/), the [US Fish and Wildlife Services](https://www.fws.gov/species/search) and the [National Inventory of Dams](https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/#/). It also includes data directly from the state organizations in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee that monitor species' endangerment.

#### The `images` directory
Images that appear or are related to the article.

#### The `maps` directory
The QGIS files for the map of endangered species in the southeast.

#### The `shapefiles` directory
The shapefiles for the geographical distribution of all federally listed endangered and threatened aquatic species that occur primarily in the southeastern region. All the files are downloaded from the [US Fish and Wildlife Services website](https://www.fws.gov/species/search).

## Methodology
In this section I explain the methodological choices I have made throughout the project and their limitations and consequences. 

**What are freshwater species?**

This project deals with freshwater species here defined as the species that by Natureserve was put in the four categories `freshwater fishes`, `freshwater mussels`, `freshwater snails`, and `crayfishes`. This means the exclusion of other potential freshwater species (salamanders, snails, shrimps etc.) that weren't put in a clear freshwater category. I decided to limit my research to freshwater species alone because the species and ecosystems are significantly different from saltwater and terrestrial species and because of the unique challenges facing this particular kind of ecosystem. 

**What is the southeast?**

I started the project looking at Alabama and expanding the research to nearby states like Mississippi and Florida. I decided to limit the research and data analysis to one region in the country to have a more comparable group of states when it comes to type of nature, species that live there etc. I settled on the Fish and Wildlife Services' Southeastern region (region 4) which includes: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.

However, there are still vast differences between these states when it comes to the number of species occuring there, the rates of endimism, the amount of remaining nature, the share of wild land protected, etc. 

**How to rank species?**

One big question was how to measure the imperilment of the in the data. Natureserve as well as the state organizations and the US Fish and Wildlife Services have two general measurements: Global Rank (G1-G5) and State Rank (S1-S5). The global rank gives a species the same score all over the globe while the state rank provides different scores based on the endangerment in a particular state. A species can thus in theory be critically imperiled in Georgia but completely secure in Florida (this rarely happens though). 

After consulting a row of experts on this, I decided that the Global Rank was too broad to use. Since it is a global rank, it has a tendancy to overestimate the endangerment/imperilment because a species in a global comparison is rare. This would be a problem, since there are high rates of endimism and a lot of rare species in the region.

Instead I decided to use the state rank. But as mentioned before, there is a 


**Things we and science still don't know**

- Still listing species
- how updated is the data
